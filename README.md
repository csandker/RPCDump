# RPCDump

Tool to dump information from RPC's local or remote Endpoint Mapper.

This is my fork of the original RPCDump written in C, published at: [https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9780596510305/blob/master/tools/rpctools/rpcdump/rpcdump.c](https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9780596510305/blob/master/tools/rpctools/rpcdump/rpcdump.c).

I ported this tool to C++ and made some smaller changes as part of my RPC Research, published at:<br>
